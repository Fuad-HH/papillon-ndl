The Papillon Nuclear Data Library (NDL) is a C++/Python library for reading,
sampling, and interacting with continuous energy nuclear data, stored in the ACE
nuclear data format.

For examples of how to use the library in both C++ and Python, take a look at
the [documentation site](https://papillon-ndl.readthedocs.io). That is where you
will also be able to fined more detailed installation instructions.

## License
PapillonNDL is provided under the terms and conditions of the CeCILLv2.1
license. This is a French equivalent of the GPLv3 license, and is explicitly
compatible with both the GPLv2 and v3. The French version of this license is
provided in the LICENSE file, along with the equally valid English version, which
may be found in the LICENSE-ENGLISH file. The CeCILLv2.1 is approved by the FSF.
More information about this license may be found [here](https://cecill.info/).

## Dependencies
The library may be built on Unix-like operating systems or on Windows. All that
is required is cmake >= 3.11, and a C++ compiler which supports the C++17
standard. For Unix-like systems, the recommended compilers are GCC >= 7 or
Clang >= 6. On Windows, you should have MSVC >= 19.15. In order to build the
Python interface, Python >= 3.5 should be installed on your system, in
addition to the Python development libraries and header files.

Tests are not built by default, and should only be needed for developers. You
can turn them on by using ```-DPNDL_TESTS=ON``` with cmake.

## Install
To build PapillonNDL, navigate to the directory where you would like to keep the
source files, and then run the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/HunterBelanger/papillon-ndl.git
$ cd papillon-ndl
$ cmake -E make_director build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ cmake --build . --target install
```

If you do NOT want to build the Python bindings for PapillonNDL, then you should
add the flag ```-DPNDL_PYTHON=OFF``` to the cmake command.
