/**
 * @brief This class is used to sample elastic scattering of neutrons off of a
 *        nuclide. It uses the Sampling of Velocity of Target (SVT) algorithm.
 *        This approach is also sometimes refered to as the Constant Cross
 *        Section (CXS) approximation. It assumes that the microscopic
 *        scattering cross section is approximately constant over the range of
 *        reletive energies which could be observed by the incident neutron (due
 *        to the direction of the target nuclides velcity being random and
 *        isotropically distributed). This method is standard in many Monte
 *        Carlo codes. Despite its ubiquity, it is known to yield inaccurate
 *        results for heavy nuclides which have scattering resonances at low
 *        energies. For these heavy nuclide, the Doppler Broadened Rejection
 *        Correction (DBRC) algorithm is better, as it is an exact treatment.
 *
 *        At certain energies, it becomes reasonable to make the approximation
 *        that the target nuclide is at rest, and has no thermal motion. The
 *        threshold for applying this approximation is set with the
 *        tar_threshold parameter. If the incident energy of the neutron (Ein)
 *        is larger than tar_threshold * temperature * k (where k is the
 *        Boltzmann constant), then the target is taken to be stationary. One
 *        exception to this rule is for nuclides with an AWR < 1 (only H1).
 *        Since H1 is actually has a slightly smaller mass than a neutron, the
 *        target at rest approximation is generally inadequate.
